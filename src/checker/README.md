# Checkers

Several checkers propose to validate some security points:
* Port listening
* SSL method authorized
* HTTP method authorized
* Default exposed path

## Port listener checker

[Check ports listen on the application server](./port/README.md)

## SSL method checker

[Check SSL methods authorized on the application server](./sslMethod/README.md)

## HTTP method checker

[Check HTTP methods authorized on the application server](./method/README.md)

## Fuzzing checker

[Check path exposed on the application server](./fuzzing/README.md)
